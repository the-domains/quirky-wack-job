# During the 1970's it was considered very cool to be a cocaine user in the United States, thanks to an association with "high class" white folks along with a price tag which made the stimulant unnaffordable for the working class. Cocaine itself had been illegal since 1914, although it was not illegal to sell paraphanelia as you can see from these vintage ads.

Since cocaine was considered relatively harmless, non-addictive, or simply a party favor for the upper class, there were of course few convictions and even fewer jail sentences. In 1973, 1 in 27 arrests were drug-related. In 2014, that number was 1 in 7\.

**What happened to usher in this cataclysmically failed "war on drugs" that has resulted in the United States now being crowned "King of Incarceration"?**

What happened was a little law called the "Anti-Drug Abuse Act" which was passed in 1986 during the Ronald Reagan presidency. Among other things, this law set some new rules for cocaine that inadvertently (or not) has led to what are currently boiling issues within a prison-for-profit system that currently imprisons millions of African-American men in the United States. 

**What in this law specifically had to do with cocaine, and how did it help lead to the United States' current issue with mass incarceration?**

I'll copy that bit directly from the "United States Sentencing Commission" website:

"The 1986 Act established two tiers of mandatory prison terms for first-time drug traffickers: a five-year and a ten-year minimum sentence. Under the statute, these prison terms are triggered exclusively by the quantity and type of drug involved in the offense."

"The 1986 Act initiated the federal criminal law distinction between 'cocaine base' and other forms of cocaine. The thresholds triggering the ten-year penalty - five kilograms of powder cocaine and 50 grams of cocaine base - create the 100-to-1 quantity ratio discussed at various points in this report."

To put this information into perspective:

In 1986, a law was passed in the United States that made it so all first-time certain-drug-related "trafficking" convictions hold a MINIMUM prison sentence of NO LESS THAN five years. In order to be charged with trafficking, one must be in possession of a certain minimum amount of whichever drug they are being charged for.

In the case of cocaine (aka 'cocaine base', the rich white man's drug of choice), the amount needed to be sent to prison for a minimum of 10 years is: 50 grams.

In the case of crack cocaine (a watered-down and chopped version, the poor black man's drug of choice), the amount needed to be sent to prison for a minimum of 5 years is: 5 grams.

Funny how the white man's drug gets all these hilarious adverts, while the black man's drug gets an entire generation thrown in prison.
